# Clock configuration

This example application shows how to configure the clock system to run the device at maximum frequency. It also outputs a prescaled clock signal on a GPIO pin for measurement and verification.

## Description

Clock system generates and distributes the clock for the processor and peripherals. This example application shows how to use the clock manager to configure the device to run at the max possible speed. A prescaled clock signal is routed to GPIO pin to measure the frequency and accuracy of the internal device clock.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_rh71) and click

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_rh71_ek.X | SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit
|||

### Setting up SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit

- Connect an oscilloscope to monitor the port pin PA11 (Pin #5 on the J24 header)
- Connect the debugger probe to J33 connector

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. Observe a clock of 2 MHz on the clock output pin
3. LED should be blinking continuosly

Refer to the following table for clock output pin and LED name for different boards:

| Board      | Clock output pin | LED Name |
| ---------- | ---------------- |--------- |
| SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit | Pin #5 on the J24 header | LED0 |

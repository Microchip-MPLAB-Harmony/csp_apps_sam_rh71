# TC compare mode

This example shows how to use the TC module in compare mode to generate an active low, active high, and toggle output on compare match.

## Description

Three TC channels are configured in compare mode. Each channel generates different output waveform depending upon configured action on compare match and period match.

**Active low output**: Output is set high on compare 1 match and is
set low on compare 0 match.

**Active high output**: Output is set low on compare 1 match and is
set high on compare 0 match.

**Toggle output**: Output toggles on compare 0 match.

# PIO polling

This example shows how to poll the switch input, and indicate the switch status using the LED.

## Description

This application uses the PIO Peripheral library to read GPIO pin connected to the switch, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate switch status. LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch is released.

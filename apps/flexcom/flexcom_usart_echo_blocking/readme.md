# FLEXCOM USART blocking

This example application shows how to use the flexcom module in USART mode.

## Description

This application configures the flexcom peripheral in USART mode and performs read and write operation in a blocking manner. The CPU polls the peripheral register continuously to manage the transfer. It receives a line of characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.

### Setting up SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit

- Connect the debugger probe to J33 connector
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a mini USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. The console displays the following message

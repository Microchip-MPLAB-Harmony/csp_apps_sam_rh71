# HEFC flash read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the HEFC to erase and program the internal Flash memory.

## Description

This example uses the HEFC peripheral library to erase a row and write an array of values to the internal Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

Access to the TCM memory is at full processor clock speed and can be accessed both by the CPU and the DMA. TCM provides deterministic behavior as it does not suffer from cache hit and cache miss. There is no explicit or extra memory for TCM. It is the internal SRAM of the microcontroller that gets partitioned as TCM + SRAM. This application uses the USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate the TCM usage. It registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. Application first transmits a message using DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA read is complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. Unlike the cache maintenance APIs, using the TCM does not pose restrictions on aligning the read and write buffers to a 32-byte boundary with a size that is a multiple of 32 bytes. An XC32 compiler attribute can be used to place the read and write buffers into the TCM memory region to avoid the issues related to cache coherency when the DMA is used with the data cache enabled.

The number of cycles taken for the transfer is measured using the System timer/Periodic Interval Timer (SysTick/PIT) to illustrate how the burst size helps to reduces the transfer time. This example also demonstrates cache maintenance operation by cleaning and invalidating cache for the buffers located in cacheable memory. The buffers are aligned to cache line and its size is an integer multiple of the cache line size. Cache line(s) for source buffer range is cleaned before submitting a transfer request to DMA to load the latest data in the cache to the RAM (SRAM/DDR). Cache line(s) for destination buffer address range is invalidated to ensure that the CPU reads the latest data from the RAM (SRAM/DDR). ",

    "content": "This example application shows how to use the cache maintenance APIs to avoid issues related to cache coherency when the data cache is enabled. Application uses USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate cache maintenance APIs provided by the Cache peripheral library. Applcation registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. It then transmits a message using the DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA readis complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. Application calls DCACHE_CLEAN_BY_ADDR API on the write buffer before transmitting it. Calling this API copies the data from the cache memory to the main memory, thereby ensuring that the DMA peripheral uses the updated values in the write buffer. Application calls the DCACHE_INVALIDATE_BY_ADDR API on the read buffer after reception of data is complete by the DMA receive channel. Calling this API invalidates the cache region corresponding to the read buffer, thereby ensuring that the CPU reads updated values in the main memory into the read buffer (and into the cache memory). Cache maintenance operations are always performed on a cache line (1 cache line = 32 bytes), thus the read and write buffers must be aligned to a 32 byte boundary and must be a multiple of 32 bytes. This is the reason why 32 byte buffers are used for receiving and echoing 10 bytes of data. ",
